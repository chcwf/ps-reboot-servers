##################### Weekly Reboot Script
##################### By Arlandus Brown III

                        #Synopsis
# Script is to reboot designated servers. Main functions are as follows....

#1. Message all logged in users of shutdown and give them time to log off
#2. Connect to vsphere and Shutdown all the VMs in your text file
#3. Disconnect the NIC on all VMs (This keeps people from hammering the servers before they are fully up again)
#4. Turn all the VMs back on again
#5. Reconnect the NICs to allow for logins again
